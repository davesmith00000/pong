# Infinite Pong!

> An infinite Pong game with finite replay value!

This is an implementation of Pong to demo [Indigo](https://indigoengine.io/)'s soon to be released physics support.

You can play it here: https://davesmith00000.github.io/pong/

It is single player, and you will probably need a mouse! (Might be touch compatible... maybe.)

### Instructions

1. Keep your mouse over the game window.
2. Click to start.
3. Move your mouse up and down to shift the paddles.
4. Try to hit the ball.
